## Knight's Tour

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on an N*N chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once.

## Rat in the Maze

In this problem, there is a given maze of size N x N. The source and the destination location is top-left cell and bottom right cell respectively. The objective is the find the path from the source to the destination if one exists.

## Graph Coloring

'm Coloring Problem'. Given an undirected graph and a number m, determine if the graph can be colored with at most m colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with same color.

## Hamiltonian Path

Hamiltonian Path in an undirected or directed graph is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. Determining whether such paths and cycles exist in a given graph using its adjency matrix.

## N*N Sodoku Board

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a N×N grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the N N^(1/2)×N^(1/2) subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to N.
This solver can solve any N*N board (e.g 9x9, 16x16 etc..)
