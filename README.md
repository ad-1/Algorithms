# Backtracking Algorithm Projects - Python

"Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution." - Wikipedia

## Knight's Tour

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on an N*N chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once.

## Rat in the Maze

In this problem, there is a given maze of size N x N. The source and the destination location is top-left cell and bottom right cell respectively. The objective is the find the path from the source to the destination if one exists.

## N Queen Problem

N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

## Subset Sum Problem

Given a set of integers and an integer s, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is s?

## Graph Coloring

'm Coloring Problem'. Given an undirected graph and a number m, determine if the graph can be colored with at most m colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with same color.

## Hamiltonian Cycle

A Hamiltonian path is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian path that is a cycle. Problem is to determine whether a and cycle exists in a graph using its adjacency matrix.

## Sodoku

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a N×N grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the N N^(1/2)×N^(1/2) subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to N.
This solver can solve any N*N board (e.g 9x9, 16x16 etc..)

Sodoku GUI designed using Tkinter for a 9x9 board. Can play game and also visualise the backtracking algorithm in progress.
