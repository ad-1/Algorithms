# Bubble Sort or Sinking Sort Algorithm

"""
    Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent
    elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

    The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

    The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for
    the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
